This program, written in C, uses the libssh library to create a basic scp program

To compile, enter the directory and type:

> mkdir build
> cmake ..
> make -j3

The 'scp' executable is then created in build

Usage: "scp <from> <to>"

Format of <from> or <to> consists of [[user@]host:]/path/to/file
